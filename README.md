# ML_Learning_Track
I wanted to build a github to track and showcase my learning progress of AI and ML systems 

MileStone #1 


Data Cleaning and Analysis <img width="25" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f942f35f-f67c-4574-b2db-62cc79ede97f" />

Data cleaning is key part of preprocessing data which makes it easy for ML models to read and make predictions. Since I am a Biomedical Engineering Major, I thought it would be intresting 
to focus on cleaning biomedical data 

MileStone #2

Linear Regression Model <img width="50" height="30" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3457b363-8392-4f0c-b237-4ffe9eaea579" />


I wanted to apply my knowledge from the Pytorch textbook to create my own linear regression model and apply it to a biomedical based dataset. 



Milestone #3 

Artifical Intelligence Agents <img width="30" height="50" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f895e72-42ce-47ad-82b6-b0b6db1e748c" />


Create my own AI agent from scratch to automate one task preferrably in healthcare/biomedical related
